# IoT Device Description Language (IoT-DDL): 
IoT-DDL is an XML-based human- and machine-readable configuration scheme to describe a thing in IoT in terms of inner components, identity, capabilities, resources, attachments and services. The IoT-DDL also describes the knowledge (social bonds and relationships) injected or acquired by the thing, as well as the different interactions that engage the thing with cloud platforms, edges, users (e.g., end-user, developer) and space-mates (nearby things or remote ones). Such configuration schemes are created by the thing vendor or owner and this then gets uploaded to the thing to enable the thing to self-discover its own power and engage with the surrounding IoT ecosystem.
